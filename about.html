        "Working on IP development with Maria was a privilege and a pleasure. Her strong understanding of the foundations of character design and art were cornerstones in our working relationship. Maria's passion and enthusiasm also led to our in-house artists developing skills and ideas which have traditionally been absent from our working environment. She's terrific to work with and a wonderful artist who we'll be happy to come to again."

        Her first contact with the arts was at 3 years old when her father taught her to read with poetry. Still 3, she also started acting and has never left the stage since. This continued relation with the stage is what cultivated her love for storytelling and characters, coulpled with her love for reading and learning languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        She has worked for Red Atoms doing character design and is currently a team member of The Oatley Academy of Visual Storytelling.

        Brimming with energy and enthusiasm, she firmly believes in the power of hugs, a smile, and chocolate to make anyone's day brighter.
